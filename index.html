          <h2>A Disproportionate Impact on Muslim-Majority Nationalities</h2>
          <p class="lead">While the Trump administration’s policy change has decreased refugee admissions across nationalities, the change in policy has disproportionately
            impacted refugees from Muslim-majority nations. Refugees from Muslim-majority nations made up 47% of total refugees resettled in the United States in 2016.
            In 2018 that share had fallen to just 9%.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The number of Somali refugees fell from 9,020 in 2016 to 267 in 2018.</li>
              <li>The number of Iraqi refugees fell from 9,880 in 2016 to 140 in 2018.</li> 
              <li>The number of Syrian refugees fell from 12,587 in 2016 to just 62 in 2018.</li>
            </ul>   
            <p class="lead"> These changes to the refugee acceptance policies have had varying impacts across the country. Michigan, for example, went from receiving 3,042 refugees from Muslim-majority nations
              (71% of total) to just 86 in 2018 (13% of total). In Texas, the number fell from 3,578 in 2016 (46% of total) to just 149 (9% of total). In 2016, 75% of states had at
              least a third of their refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations. By 2018, no state had at least a third of their refugees coming from a Muslim-majority nation, with 8 states and DC receiving no refugees from Muslim-majority nations at all.
              Even if a state wants to admit more refugees they have little recourse for influencing the number of refugees resettled in their jurisdiction. </p>

            <h2>What determines where refugees are resettled within the United States?</h2>
            <p class="lead"> Once a refugee is admitted into the United States, they are matched with a nonprofit Volunteer Resettlement Agency (VOLAG) 
              who is tasked with providing sponsorship, initial housing, food, clothing, orientation, and counseling. These organizations are scattered 
              across the country and rely primarily on federal funding to support their activities. The decrease in refugees admissions has already resulted 
              in the closure of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-refugees-exclusive/exclusive-dozens-of-refugee-resettlement-offices-to-close-as-trump-downsizes-program-idUSKCN1FY1EJ">dozens of VOLAG offices across the country</a>, 
              with the government submitting a plan to close nearly a quarter of the offices, eliminating offices in Hawaii, West Virginia, and Louisiana all together.

              <p class="lead">
                  Misinformation has driven many negative conceptions about refugees, particularly those coming from Muslim-majority nations. However, emerging research disproves these myths. 
                  A recent report from Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab indicates that reducing the number of refugees in a community <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2x7p/">does not reduce the crime rate</a>. 
                  Research from the Center for American Progress finds that refugees quickly become self-sufficient and, in the long-run, become well-integrated into society, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2016/06/16/139551/refugee-integration-in-the-united-states/">having similar rates of labor force participation, wages and business ownership</a> as their U.S. born neighbors. 
                  Rather than being a financial burden to the U.S., research found that between 2005 and 2013 refugees and asylees contributed <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/immigration/data-defies-trump-claims-that-refugees-and-asylees-are-a-taxpayer-burden/">$63 billion more in taxes than they utilized in public services</a>.

                  These findings have highlighted the need to set standards to preserve the United States’ legacy as a country that actively welcomes refugees. Massachusetts U.S. Ed Markey has proposed the “Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement Act”, or GRACE ACT, to set an annual refugee admissions floor of 95,000 (the historic average). 
                  The International Rescue Committee provides information on how to <a href="https://www.rescue.org/take-action/tell-your-senators-co-sponsor-grace-act">contact your senator</a> to pledge support for the Act.  
                  <br />
      
                  <br>
                  With declining federal contributions, the VOLAGs are increasingly relying on private contributions and philanthropy to support their work.
